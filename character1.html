                <h2>BACKGROUND STORY</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Clandestine organizations have existed throughout many ages of the Land of Dawn's history. No one knows the true purpose of these organizations, but one thing is for sure, whenever a crisis is in hand, one of their mysterious creations emerge from the shadows to restore order to the world
                </p>
                <p>
                    Professor Henry and his wife worked for the Dawn Council, known for its research in cutting-edge technology, and providing an endless and varied stream of high-tech products to government agencies and mysterious, anonymous clients. But, when they finally finished developing their manually operated robot, SMART-01, all this changed. Their new creation was more intelligent and powerful than any android robot the world had seen before and was also designed, such that once a genetically matched host controlled it, it could act according to the controller's consciousness.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The leader of the Dawn Council saw the potential of this technology, for warfare and ordered the Henry's to transfer the technology to the selected government agencies for a mass production program. The Henry's refused. After ordering their Prototype SMART-01 to destroy all of the experimental data, the Henrys mysteriously disappeared.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To this day, little Ellie had no knowledge of these events, however, after her parents went missing, she had been targeted by the Dawn Council, as an important hostage. To obtain the truth behind the Henry's disappearance, the scientists of the Dawn Council barged into the Henry's house and violently tried to seize Ellie. However, Ellie managed to evade these bad people and dashed out of her house. As Ellie ran ahead of the chasing mob of scientists, she remembered, what her father had once told her: "Remember Ellie, when there is no way out, press the button on your pocket watch and think hardly of me and the guardian will show up to protect you". Ellie did just as her father had told her to, and asked for her father for help, as she ran, her little legs barely able to move any longer, when all of a sudden a big box dropped between her and her pursuers. The box had an inscription: GUARDIAN CLASS-1.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A powerful beam split apart the box and from within, emerged the robot SMART-01. Ellie's heart beat faster as it walked up to her and scanned her face. Recognizing her to be a VIP host, SMART-01 engaged Guardian mode on Ellie. Then looking around at the mad scientists, SMART-01 activated it's Elimination mode. The people tried to attack SMART-01, but it released a flurry of missiles and grenades, turning every one of them, but Ellie, to ash.
                </p>

                <p>
                    She understood the true power of SMART-01, also realizing that there were secret gears hidden inside this pocket watch. She wondered if it might hold any clues to find her parents. She turned to SMART-01 and gave her next order, commanding the robot to help her find her parents with the help of this pocket watch. SMART-01 scanned the pocket watch with his inbuilt sensors, and indicated three possible locations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After the passage of these events, all she knew and cared about was that this special robot had always been there to protect and accompany her. SMART-01 occasionally calls her Honeybear, just like her father qdid, while she affectionately calls him Jawhead, in return. Finally, with the support of Jawhead, Ellie gathered enough courage and decided to journey with her robot friend to track down her parent's whereabouts, deciding that she would be much stronger when she would meet her parents, the next time.
